# Machine-learning-Cross-sell-Prediction

This is based on tutorial from Mi AI channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xob-qUmSPA

We have database of customer buying vehicle insurance, and we offer them another insurance. Part of customers say yes.
Let's build a model to prediction customer who say yes to buy new insurance.

There are 2 Jupyter notebook:
prediction 1: transfer all columns to feature and not drop any data
prediction 2: drop/transfer some columns to more simple dataset

The result shows that class Weight method works well with imbalanced data although it over catch 'not response cases'
and drop or not drop columns doesn't help much for this case

Please give me feedback if you have any concern or build on
